# Encryption and Decryption in JavaScriptðŸ˜‰
 - Uses CryptoJS AES encryption and decryption with a key of size 64 self generated by server.
 - First of all it encrypts message(maybe string or object) using key generated.
 - The encrypted data is converted into binary digit format using huffman encoding which gives a data table and string of data as output
 - The obtained huffman string is compressed using Run-length encoding (RLE) technique 
 - Now both data table and huffman string is encrypted with same key
 - To encrypt it takes single digit milliseconds thus can be used anywhere to transfer data securely.
